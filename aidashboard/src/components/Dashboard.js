          <strong>How it works:</strong>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li>1. Describe your symptoms or health concerns.</li>
            <li>2. The AI will analyze your inputs and suggest possible causes.</li>
            <li>3. Based on your symptoms, the AI will recommend next stepsâ€”whether it's self-care, seeing a doctor, or seeking emergency help.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
            <li>The AI assistant provides general guidance. For accurate diagnosis, always consult a professional healthcare provider.</li>
            <li>This service is not intended to replace a doctor's advice.</li>
            <li>If your symptoms are severe or life-threatening, seek immediate medical attention.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Stay healthy and take care! Remember, while AI can help identify patterns, nothing replaces the expertise of a real doctor. If you're ever in doubt, it's always best to seek in-person medical care.
